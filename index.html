								<b>LOADR - Full stack web application development</b><br>&emsp;
								The current project I'm on is full-stack development for an internal company web application. LOADR is based off of the L3Harris Software Catalog I created.
								LOADR tracks things from full projects and missions to algorithms, datasets, and tools. With no prior experience in .NET, Angular, or full-stack 
								engineering as a whole, I was able to pick up all necessary skills in under a month and continued to learn on the way. I was 
								tasked with various things ranging from refactoring the entire API so that we could separate out the service layer, to adding 
								a feature on both the front and back end to allow for bulk uploads, making data transfers easier, to creating integration tests 
								for each controller within the API. 
								<br> <br>
								<b>Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) Requirement Transfer - Python web scraping</b><br>&emsp;
								For my second project at L3Harris, I was told we needed a way to transfer requirements from the FAA's website to Cameo System Modeler, 
								a software that systems engineers use to plan projects, which I had no experience with. With no other instruction, I decided to use the 
								Python libraries Beautiful Soup and Pandas to extract the data, manipulate it as needed, and export it to a CSV. Each top-level requirement 
								had multiple subparts, as many as six layers, that needed to be nested within the parent requirements. Over two and a half months I developed 
								Python scripts to populate four models consisting of over 10,000 requirements which saved the company a minimum of 400 hours of initial work 
								and 60 hours of work each following month as the scripts can be automated to update all of the requirements without someone having to manually 
								check that each one is up to date.
								<br><br>
								<b>L3Harris Software Catalog - PowerApps</b><br>&emsp;
								I was first asked to create a software catalog that would allow everyone in the company to share software that their office created. I was only 
								given a PowerPoint slide with a visual layout of what the catalog should look like. In under a month, I went on to learn PowerApps, SharePoint, 
								and PowerAutomate and developed a fully functioning catalog. A SharePoint list acted as the database, PowerApps was used to create a user-friendly 
								interface, PowerAutomate sent automatic emails for creation, deletion, and reminders, and the catalog was deployed on a SharePoint side. I went on 
								to present my catalog to numerous higher-ups and got exposure to high-level brainstorms. Each time I presented I took the given feedback and reworked 
								the catalog multiple times to ensure it was always growing.

								<b>Senior Design Project</b> - Soccer Goalie VR Application
							</p>
								&emsp;For my senior year capstone project, I worked on a team with three other students. We created 
								a Virtual Reality application for soccer goalies to practice defending penalty kicks. We used 
								<a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/?utm_source=GoogleSearch&utm_medium=Performance&utm_campaign=3Q_UnrealEngine_MMT_Brand_Link-Clicks_Search_US&utm_id=18077327933&sub_campaign=&utm_content=&utm_term=unrealengine"target="_blank">Unreal Engine</a>
								, a 3D computer graphic game engine, to create the environment, animate the avatar, and animate the flight path of the ball. Matlab was used to 
								create over 30 realistic soccer ball flight paths. The application was deployed on a Meta Oculus as seen in one of the photos above.

								<b>Teach Assistant</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								&emsp;My senior year of college I was a teaching assistant for two courses. I held heavily atteneded office hours and 
								graded for a third year level computer networks class. I also assisted a freshman level multidisciplinary engineering
								projects class in which I helped in person twice a week in the lab and graded.

							</p>
							<p>
								&emsp;During the summer of 2021, I was selected to participate in the Villanova Summer INNOVATE Program.  Over 10 weeks, I worked in a multidisciplinary 
								team of 3 other students to design and develop a working prototype to address a stakeholder need.  Upon researching the needs of the auditory 
								impaired, we chose to develop a speech-to-text eyeglass prototype to facilitate communication. We utilized a Raspberry Pi, 3D printing and
								an open source deep learning speech to text model to create our prototype. It successfully translated speech to text in real time
								and displayed it on the lenses to assist people with auditory impairment. An image of our project can be seen in the slides above.

								&emsp;Throughout my sophmore, junior and senior year, I was a lab assistand in the VU WRAP Lab(Villanova University Word Recognition & Auditory Perception).
								While in the lab, my time was divided between running student subjects for active studies, including setting them up on an
								EEG (electroencephalogram), and working on an in-house machine learning model. The model is designed to take a part of a sentence and predict the next word.

							<p>
								&emsp;I graduated from Villanova University in May of 2023. I have a deep love of technology, sports and the enviroment.
								I have gained diverse experience from college, internships and my job at L3Harris. I love to learn and finding new 
								things to challenge me, these experiences and drive to learn have lead to me being proficient in: Fullstack development 
								(.Net, Angular, React, React Native, MySQL), Various coding languages (Python, C#, C++/C, Java, JavaScript), Agile software
								development (JIRA, Scrum, KanBan, GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket). I learn new skills and very quickly and many of the skills I listed
								I learned on the job. <br> 
								
								&emsp;I love sports, from football to lacrosse to soccer. I played varsity football and lacrosse in high school. Since then I find
								any way I can to play sports, from club to intramural to city recreational leagues. I also love combining my love of sports
								and technology which is why I interned at KinoTek, and is the reason behind my senior design project idea and my particpation 
								in the sport tech sprint. I love the idea of using technology to improving sports and personal fitness in general <br>

								&emsp;Going hand and hand with sports, I love staying active, espically staying active outdoors. I love finding any reason to be outside,
								from hiking, to swimming, to just playing catch outside. My love of the outdoors fueled me to paricipate in the Boy Scouts of America 
								when I was younger. In that time, I achieved the highest rank, Eagle Scout. As an Eagle Scout, I developed leadership, 
								organizational, and communication skills. Two-time high school football and lacrosse varsity letter holder, 
								which developed my collaboration skills. My love of the outdoors and my particpation in Boy Scouts has made me develop a deep love
								of the enviroment and given me a disire to preserve it for future generations.
